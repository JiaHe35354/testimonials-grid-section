## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Using CSS Grid to layout the testimonials container and place each testimonial in its designated grid area

- Used Flexbox to lay out the testimonials on smaller screens

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.testimonials {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  column-gap: 3rem;
  row-gap: 2.5rem;
}

@media (max-width: 62.5em) {
  .testimonials {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 3rem;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to explore more layout and responsive design using CSS Grid in the future.
